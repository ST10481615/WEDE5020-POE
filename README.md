Styling and Design
The website's look is built with a single main file called style.css. This makes it clean and easy to use on any device.

Key Design Features
Fits Any Screen: The website changes its layout to fit any screen, like a phone or a computer.

The page uses a grid for products and blog posts so they line up neatly.

The top menu uses a special layout called Flexbox to keep everything clean and spaced out.

Interactive Design: The website reacts to your actions to feel more alive.

Hover Effects: When you move your mouse over things like products, buttons, or blog posts, they change. For example, product cards lift up and buttons change color.

Focus States: When you click on a box to type, a blue shadow appears around it to show you where you are typing.

Look and Feel:

Font: The website uses the Inter font. It's a clean font that's easy to read and looks modern.

Colors: The colors are a mix of deep blue and gray, plus a bright blue gradient on the main home page. This makes the website look professional and consistent.

Easy to Reuse Code: The style.css file has special classes like .container and .shadow-md. These are like shortcuts you can use on different parts of the website to keep the design the same. This makes it easier to update the site later.
